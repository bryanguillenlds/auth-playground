# Rest Project + TypeScript

This pre-initialized project has everything needed to work with TypeScript, Express, and Rest.

Each step of its configuration has already been completed previously in the course, so you only need to clone the project and start working.


## Installation

1. Clone .env.template to .env and configure the environment variables
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. If a database is needed, configure the docker-compose.yml and run `docker-compose up -d` to start the desired services.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the project in development mode
